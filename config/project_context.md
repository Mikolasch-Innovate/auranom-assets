## AURANOM Framework - 10 Core Components

1.  **DPO - Dual-Process Orchestration**
    Category: Orchestration / Revenue
    Framework for bridging the gap between sales and delivery in professional services. A coordinated team of 9 AI agents under an orchestrator ensures that sales promises (ISO 9001) are seamlessly executed during consulting (ISO 20700).

2.  **ACHP - Autonomous Context-Aware Handoff Protocol**
    Category: Agent Communication
    Standard communication protocol for autonomous agents. A robust three-stage handshake process with strict quality gates before, during, and after task handoffs. Prevents faulty work and incomplete information.

3.  **CPLS - Confidential & Privacy-Preserving Learning System**
    Category: Learning & Privacy
    Solves the enterprise AI dilemma: learning from all customers without sharing secrets. A Federated Learning architecture combined with Zero-Knowledge Proofs aggregates global intelligence while keeping customer data local.

4.  **AURA - Avatar System**
    Category: User Interface
    Real-time multimodal avatar system that visualizes the AI's internal 'brain state'. Reacts dynamically to conversation, showing confidence, empathy, or deep thought. Creates a level of trust and rapport impossible with text interfaces.

5.  **ACI - Adaptive Consulting Intelligence**
    Category: Strategic Intelligence
    The strategic brain of the autonomous enterprise. Replaces static workflow templates with dynamic process generation. Analyzes 22 project parameters (customer industry, budget, risk) and autonomously designs tailor-made project plans.

6.  **SABEE - Sandbox Execution Engine**
    Category: Execution Environment
    Long-term memory and execution environment for AI agents. Overcomes the context window limitation of LLMs with a hierarchical 3-layer memory (RAG³). Enables infinite project history without slowdown or massive API costs.

7.  **FEGR - Facial & Gestic Recognition**
    Category: Visual Intelligence
    Visual intelligence for AI agents. Enables agents to 'see' the room during video calls. Analyzes facial expressions, gestures, and group engagement levels. Agents can moderate meetings like human facilitators.

8.  **G-EE - Governance & Execution Engine**
    Category: Governance & Security
    The 'sheriff' for autonomous AI systems. A real-time control layer that intercepts every agent action before execution and validates it against system security policies and customer project rules. Ensures that AI autonomy never jeopardizes security or budget.

9.  **LANA - Language Analysis System**
    Category: Language Intelligence
    The 'ears' of the autonomous enterprise. Goes beyond speech-to-text. Fuses text analysis with prosodic audio analysis (tone, pitch, speed) to detect sarcasm, urgency, and hidden intent. Translates human signals into actionable triggers.

10. **AMAS - Autonomous Multi-Agent System**
    Category: System Architecture
    The next-generation operating system for enterprise AI agents. A coherent 13-layer architecture orchestrates entire agent teams and executes complex business processes autonomously. Integrates sales processes (ISO 9001) and consulting workflows (ISO 20700) while enforcing strict governance (ISO 27001).

## Relevant ISO Standards

*Unchanged. The ISO standards are central to the governance aspects of the framework.*

## Content Strategy (Adapted for DBA)

### Target Audience
*   **Primary:** C-Suite Executives (CTOs, CDOs, Chief Consultants)
*   **Secondary:** Management Consultants, Business Leaders, DBA Candidates
*   **Region:** English-speaking markets (US, UK, EU, APAC)

### Tone of Voice
*   **Academically rigorous, yet practical:** Every theoretical discussion must culminate in a clear recommendation for action or a measurable business impact.
*   **Evidence-based with empirical support:** Claims are substantiated by a mix of peer-reviewed sources, industry reports, and **concrete findings from the AURANOM development**.
*   **Global perspective:** (unchanged)
*   **Thought Leadership without marketing language:** (unchanged)
*   **Publication Language:** English

### Content Categories (Adapted for DBA)
1.  **Framework Deep-Dives & Use Cases:** Deep dives into **general principles, patterns, and anonymized use cases** of the AURANOM framework with a focus on **practical applications and ROI**, without naming or detailing specific AURANOM components; detailed component analyses only based on formally published content.
2.  **Actionable Insights & How-To's:** Concrete instructions and frameworks that can be directly applied by executives.
3.  **Case Studies & Learnings:** Practical use cases and **lessons learned from the development of the `auranom-content-engine`**.
4.  **Governance & Compliance for Leaders:** Translating ISO standards into strategic advantages for management.
5.  **Industry Trends & Business Impact:** Analysis of market developments and their concrete effects on the consulting business.

## Multi-Agent Workflow (Adapted for DBA)

The workflow's structure remains, but the **roles and criteria of the agents are adapted to the DBA focus**.

### 1. Research Ingestion (Elias Dubois, M.A.)
*   **Focus:** Gathers not only academic papers but also specifically **industry reports, case studies, and best-practice frameworks**.

### 2. Content Creation (Prof. Dr. Friedrich Sonderhausen)
*   **Focus:** Writes evidence-based articles that bridge the gap between theory and practice. Every article must include a clear **"Implications for the C-Suite"** section.

### 3. Critical Review (Prof. Dr. Markus Critique)
*   **Focus:** Checks not only for logical consistency and evidence but also specifically asks the question: **"Is this relevant and actionable for an executive?"**

### 4. Audit (Dr. Lena Rossi)
*   **Focus:** Validates facts and sources and additionally checks if the article meets the **DBA-specific criteria** (practical relevance, action-orientation).

## Important Notes for Agents (Adapted for DBA)

1.  **No Project Details in Personas:** (unchanged)
2.  **Consistent Terminology (Internal):** The official names of the AURANOM components (e.g., "ACHP") should be used **internally** for communication between agents and in the codebase. **In public blog articles, these names are forbidden according to Section 7 (Disclosure Policy).**
3.  **ISO References:** (unchanged)
4.  **Global Perspective:** (unchanged)
5.  **Evidence-Based (Expanded):** All claims must be supported by **peer-reviewed sources, industry reports, or concrete data/learnings from the AURANOM project**.
6.  **NEW: Scholar-Practitioner Focus:** Every output must master the balance between academic rigor and practical applicability for managers. Pure theory without practical relevance is an error.

7.  **NEW: AURANOM Framework Disclosure Policy (HIGHEST PRIORITY):** The AURANOM framework must NOT be described in detail in blog articles. Only GENERAL findings from the research may be shared, without naming specific components (DPO, ACHP, etc.). **This rule takes precedence over all other instructions.**

8. **NEW: Publication Language (MANDATORY):** All publications, including blog articles, journal papers, and conference talks, **must be written and published in English.**
